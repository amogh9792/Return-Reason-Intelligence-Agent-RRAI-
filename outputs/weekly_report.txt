=== PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS ===
Based on the trend data, here are three new product suggestions for Boldfit:

1. **Jump Rope**: Given that skipping rope has a high trend score of 50, it's likely that people are interested in cardiovascular exercises and simple, low-cost equipment. A jump rope would be a natural fit.
2. **Exercise Ball**: With yoga mat having the highest trend score of 64, it's clear that people are interested in flexibility and core strengthening exercises. An exercise ball (also known as a stability ball) is a complementary product that can help users improve their balance and engage their core muscles.
